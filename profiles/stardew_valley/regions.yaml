# Stardew Valley UI Region Definitions
#
# Teacher Note: This file defines WHERE on the screen each UI element appears.
# These coordinates are for 1920x1080 resolution. If your resolution differs,
# you'll need to adjust these values.
#
# How to find these values:
#   1. Take a screenshot of the game
#   2. Open in an image editor (Paint, GIMP, etc.)
#   3. Find the UI element and note its pixel coordinates
#   4. Record: x (left edge), y (top edge), width, height
#
# The coordinate system:
#   (0,0) is the TOP-LEFT corner of the screen
#   x increases going RIGHT
#   y increases going DOWN

# Base resolution these coordinates were measured at
resolution:
  width: 1920
  height: 1080

# Health and Energy bars (bottom-right of screen in Stardew Valley)
#
# Teacher Note: Stardew Valley shows energy as a vertical bar on the right side.
# The bar fills from bottom to top. We detect the fill percentage by counting
# colored pixels vs empty pixels in this region.
#
# NOTE: These are PLACEHOLDER values! You need to measure your actual game.
# Run the calibration tool to get accurate coordinates for your setup.

ui_regions:
  # Energy bar - the tall vertical bar on the right side
  # In Stardew Valley, this is actually "energy" not "health"
  # It's green when full, yellow when medium, red when low
  energy_bar:
    x: 1260        # Left edge of the energy bar
    y: 595         # Top of the bar region
    width: 25      # How wide the bar is
    height: 175    # How tall the bar is (full length)

    # Detection settings
    fill_direction: "bottom_to_top"  # Bar fills from bottom

    # Color ranges for detection (HSV format)
    # Teacher Note: HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) is easier to work with than RGB
    # for color detection because it separates color (hue) from brightness (value)

      full:    # Green - high energy

  # but we define this for games that do (or for the player health in combat)
