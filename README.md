# 🛠️ Game Trainer Practice Project

Welcome to my chaotic coding sandbox! 🎮

This project is where I explore and practice creating tools for local single-player games. It’s a playground to help me:

- 🔧 Build scalable, responsive GUIs in **C#** using Windows Forms
- ⚙️ Handle memory-heavy operations and low-level tasks in **C++**
- 🔗 Learn how to **bridge C# and C++** — sending data back and forth like an old-school LAN party
- 💥 Experiment with memory allocation, pointers, and how to crash games for fun (and learning!)

## 💡 What I’m Practicing

- Clean GUI design in C#
- Interfacing C# with native C++ DLLs
- Understanding how memory gets allocated, edited, and sometimes horribly misused
- Reverse engineering basic game behavior
- Breaking things until they make sense

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is purely educational and only targets **local single-player games** that I own. No online cheating, no piracy, no shady business.

Just a nerd pushing memory around to see what breaks first.

Stay tuned as I learn how to build better tools, avoid memory leaks (maybe), and get more comfortable mixing managed and unmanaged code.
